## 📈 Data Wrangling & Visualizations

### **Problems**

#### **PROBLEM 1: Initial Data Exploration**
- **Task**:
  - Load the CSV file into a DataFrame named `cars` using Pandas.
  - Display the first five and last five rows of `cars`.

#### **PROBLEM 2: Advanced Data Manipulation**
- **Task Details**:
  1. Save output as `Surname_Pandas-P.py`:
     - Extract and display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns.
  2. Save output as `Surname_Pandas-P2.py`:
     - Find the row for the car model "Mazda RX4".
     - Determine and display the number of cylinders ('cyl') for "Camaro Z28".
     - Extract and list cylinders ('cyl') and gear type ('gear') for "Mazda RX4 Wag", "Ford Pantera L", and "Honda Civic".
